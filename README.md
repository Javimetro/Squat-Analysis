# Squat-Analysis
This repository contains jupyter lab notebooks. In them, the movement of the knee during the squat is analyzed using the data obtained with a MoveSense sensor.

-Y archives contains the first steps of the analysis. Using them I have learned how to manipulate the data from the sensor and how to document the results.

In the R3 archive I make the final analysis which contains the phi and theta angles, these angles tell to the final user in a understandable way how the knee moves during a squat.
To get the data I have used a MoveSense sensor that uses accelerometer and gyroscope in the x,y and z axis.

Code has been wrote using Python.
